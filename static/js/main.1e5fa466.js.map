This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks.

This is a city at the edge of Europe and at the centre of the ancient world, a place where souk-like markets rub against baroque churches, where date palms frame Gothic palaces and where the blue-eyed and fair have bronze-skinned cousins.</p>\n            <p>Centuries of dizzying highs and crushing lows have formed a complex metropolis. Here, crumbling staircases lead to gilded ballrooms and guarded locals harbour hearts of gold. Just don't be fooled. Despite its noisy streets, Sicily’s largest city is a shy beast, rewarding the inquisitive with citrus-filled cloisters, stucco-laced chapels and vintage stores filled with the threads of faded aristocrats. Add to this Italy’s biggest opera house and an ever-growing number of vibrant, new-school eateries and bars and you might just find yourself suddenly, unexpectedly in love.</p>\n            <cite>\n              <span>- Lonely Planet</span>\n              <small>\n                <a\n                  className='light'\n                  href='https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/sicily/palermo'\n                  target='_blank'\n                >\n                  Link to the online guide\n                </a>\n              </small>\n            </cite>\n            <div className='content' style={{marginTop: 15}}>\n              <Mobile />\n              <Desktop />\n              <div>\n                <h3>Sicily</h3>\n                <p>Eternal crossroads of the Mediterranean, the gorgeous island of Sicily continues to seduce travellers with its dazzling diversity of landscapes and cultural treasures.</p>\n                <p>Watch the video!
